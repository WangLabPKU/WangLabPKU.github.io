> Stem cell, an undifferentiated cell that can divide to produce some offspring cells that continue as stem cells and some cells that are destined to differentiate (become specialized). They are expected to be used to cure various diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, etc. In order to realize the potential of stem cells to cure diseases, we must understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the proliferation (or self-renewal) and directed differentiation of stem cells. 

## About us

Our lab mainly studies the role of non-coding RNA, the dark matter in cells, during the process of proliferation (or self-renewal) and directed differentiation of stem cells. 
Our current research focuses on embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), using cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and bioinformatics, combined with new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), high-throughput screening, and gene editing. The research content covers stem cell related biological process mechanism, disease model and drug target, as well as the development of generic new technologies related to basic or applied research. We hope to find new targets and techniques to control stem cell proliferation (or self-renewal) and directed differentiation by these researches.

## Major Achievements

- Established a miRNA full knockout mESC, and the first to reveal the important role of the miRNA pathway in the proliferation and differentiation of ESCs
- Discovered the miR-290/302 family that regulate the functions of embryonic stem cell proliferation, cell cycle, glycolytic metabolism and self-renewal, and revealed the molecular mechanism
- Invented the technology platform that miRNA activates the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, and the novel non-coding RNA promoter activity reporter gene technology
- Elucidated important function of a lncRNA in regulating FGF/ERK signaling and self-renewal of ESCs
- Discovered the novel molecular pathway, PIAS4-SUMO2-DPPA2/4, regulating zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in early embryonic development and transformation of totipotent stem cells in vitro
