> Engineering uses science and math to solve real world problems. Cellular and Molecular Engineering uses the principles of engineering and life sciences to manipulate and understand biologic processes at cellular or molecular levels. Cells were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. Proteins were discovered by Antoine Fourcroy in 1789. Nucleic acids were discovered by Friedrich Miescher in 1868. In the 21st century, it is time to use principles we have learned from them to create something new, useful, and fun.

### About us

Our lab have mainly focused on studying the molecular mechanisms controlling the self-renewal and cell fate determination of embryonic stem cells, especially those related to noncoding RNAs including microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, the so called dark matter in cells. However, our current research mainly focuses on using interdisciplinary engineering approaches to develop new technologies addressing problems in RNA biology and stem cell biology. We are also interested in developing new genome editing tools. Devoted students and researchers with background in cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, chemistry, and bioinformatics with an ambition in creating new things to understand biology or benefit human health are always welcome to visit or join us.

### Major Achievements in past 10 years

- Discovered the miR-290/302 family that regulate the functions of embryonic stem cell proliferation, cell cycle, glycolytic metabolism and self-renewal, and revealed the molecular mechanism.
- Invented miRNA inducible CRISPR-Cas9 platform (MICR) that can be used as a sensor for miRNA expression and cell-specific genome editing tool.
- Invented a novel promoter activity reporter (GRIT) tracking the transcription of lncRNAs and stem cell state.
- Identified a lncRNA regulating FGF/ERK signaling and self-renewal of ESCs.
- Discovered the novel molecular pathway, PIAS4-SUMO2-DPPA2/4, regulating zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in early embryonic development and transformation of totipotent stem cells _in vitro_.
- Develop Ddd_Ss-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBE_Ss) and introduce mutations at multiple mitochondrial DNA loci including previously inaccessible GC context.
